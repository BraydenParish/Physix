A high-octane, browser-based 3D FPS that replaces canned death animations with raw, unscripted physics. You don't just "kill" enemies, you dismantle their momentum. Built on a proprietary dual-layer engine, the game blends tactical "wireframe" precision with the slapstick brutality of an active ragdoll sandbox.
